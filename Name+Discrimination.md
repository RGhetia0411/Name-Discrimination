# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market

### Background
Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.

### Data
In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.

Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer.

### Exercises
You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.

Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. 

   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?
   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?
   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value.
   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.
   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?

    Number of calls for a black sounding name is 157 and the number of calls for a white sounding name is 235

#Question 1
#We need to compare the differnece
#between the two proportions to a null value
#so z test would be more appropriate
#CLT applies because of the categorical data.
```

```python
#Question 2
#Null hypothesis is there is no
#difference between black sounding names and
#white sounding names for interviews.

#Alternative hypothesis is there is a difference
#between black sounding names and white sounding
#names for interviews.

    P-value is given by 0.000039 and the z -score is given by 4.114705

#Question 5
#Null hypothesis is incorrect because p-value
